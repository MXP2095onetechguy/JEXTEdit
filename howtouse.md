# Building
Import this project to eclipse or other IDEs(if it supports eclipse project)

Install the dependencies with maven

# Running from eclipse
Just click the run button

# Running from Jar

Put the jar on a directory and then run it from the command line, because the editor needs to extract itself to get access to the resources that way when packed in jar.
